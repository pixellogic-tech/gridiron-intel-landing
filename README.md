About Gridiron

Gridiron was born out of long nights, cold practices, and film sessions that went nowhere. We got tired of tools built by people who’ve never stepped on turf. So we built our own.

This isn’t another highlight app. Gridiron breaks down film like a coach who never sleeps — spotting tendencies, predicting plays, and showing each player exactly where they win or fall short. It’s built for teams that want to outwork, outthink, and outplay everyone else.

You can name your own AI, set your team colors, and lock in your edge. When game day comes, Gridiron already knows the opponent better than they know themselves.

Game-ready for the 2026 season. Built by ballers, not suits.
